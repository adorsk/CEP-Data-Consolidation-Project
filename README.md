# Summer 2017 Clean Energy Project Data Consolidation Project

This summer I am working as part of the Aspuru-Guzik Research Lab of the Harvard Clean Energy Project. The lab has run simulations of millions of potential molecules that can be used for more efficient solar cells and other clean energy technologies. However, much of the output data has been scattered across different storage systems and directories, and the current database system in MongoDB is somewhat oudated. 

My responsibility for this summer is to consolidate the data from simulations the CEP has run so far and update/modernize the database. I also have the secondary goal of creating interesting visualizations for this data that would be useful for the CEP and/or presentable to a layperson or scientist in a tangential field. 

This is the repository housing my files for this project, though care will be taken to ensure that my login credentials or other sensitive data are not leaked in this repository.
