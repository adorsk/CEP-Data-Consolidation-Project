# Rough Draft Schedule

## Introduction

Alex mentioned the Agile methodology in this morning's meeting:
- key component is to estimate time it will take to do each thing and review it afterwards. 
- It is very hard to estimate time correctly, even for experienced developers, but get better with practice. 

Goals of this document:
- provide some degree of structure for the summer and serve as a rough roadmap
	+ hard to do since it's only the first day and I still do not know the structure of the CEP files yet, but still a useful exercise
- help me practice my time estimation skills as a developer



## The Schedule Itself

Note that these time periods, even as estimates, are not hard caps -- rather, several of the tasks split among weeks are going to blend in with each other and be performed asynchronously (i.e. overlap in time and not necessarily be completed in this order). 

Time Period | Tasks
--- | ---
Week 1 | <ul><li>Set up communication protocols and take care of general administrative items</li><li>Attain basic familiarity with project technologies:<ul><li>Odyssey</li><li>MongoDB</li><li>Docker</li></ul></li><li>Review technologies I have worked with before:<ul><li>Bash/CLI</li><li>Python</li></ul></li></ul> 
Weeks 2-4 | <ul><li>Begin prowling Odyssey and other RC resources for CEP Work Units</li><li>Understand the basic structures of said work units to be able to consolidate them</li><li>Create a unified schema in MongoDB that matches different work units' formats</li><li>Determine possible side-project visualizations of CEP data</li></ul>
Weeks 5-6 | <ul><li>Consolidate remaining Odyssey/RC work units (these ones are probably harder to reach/find and in stranger formats) and integrate them into the existing database</li><li>Begin actually creating the aforementioned data visualizations</li></ul>
Weeks 7-9 | <ul><li>Continue working on data visualizations</li><li>Continue working on aforementioned tasks that have not yet been completed</li></ul>
Week 10 | <ul><li>Write-up summer project</li><li>Next steps?</li>
