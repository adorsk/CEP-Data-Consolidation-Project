#Savvy's Summer 2017 Project Log

##Monday, May 22

- First day on the job! :)
- Alex thought I was starting next week, so everything was a little bit disorganized. However, this might be good because it allows more flexibility and we are all on the same page. 
- We started by going over some basic expectations and taking care of some initial operational stuff. 
	+ Created a shared Trello to outline tasks, etc. [Link to First Week Planning Trello board](https://trello.com/b/rSJNqnK7/first-week)
	+ Alex gave me a very high-level overview of the job -- still need to find out more. 
- Took care of I-9 form and card swipe access with Felix -- **still need to get Slack set up, Mailing List Access, Group Calendar**
- Went through a review of UNIX shell [Link here](https://software.rc.fas.harvard.edu/training/workshop_intro_unix/latest/#(1))
- Research Computing (RC) and Odyssey:
	+ Created an account
	+ Read through several of the docs pages
	+ Watched the introduction video, completed the online quiz and survey (done with necessary steps)
	+ Still need to familiarize myself more with file structure of the Work Units -- going to wait until next week to do that since Odyssey will go down for maintenance tonight through the next 3 days
- Did some general customization/installation on the Mac that has been assigned to me for the summer
	+ installed Sublime Text, Chrome
	+ went through all the settings
	+ generally familiarized myself with the operating system -- feeling much more comfortable
	+ generally started establishing a workflow for myself


###Notes for tomorrow:

- Waiting on Siria to add me to:
	+ Slack
	+ Mailing List
	+ Group Calendar
