# Savvy's Summer 2017 Project Log

## Monday, May 22

- First day on the job! :)
- Alex thought I was starting next week, so everything was a little bit disorganized. However, this is a good thing in my eyes because it allows more flexibility and we are all on the same page. 
- We started by going over some basic expectations and taking care of some initial operational stuff. 
	+ Created a shared Trello to outline tasks, etc. [Link to First Week Planning Trello board](https://trello.com/b/rSJNqnK7/first-week)
	+ Alex gave me a very high-level overview of the job -- still need to find out more. 
	+ 
- Took care of I-9 form and card swipe access with Felix -- **still need to get Slack set up, Mailing List Access, Group Calendar**
- Established communication protocols:
	+ Trello (see above)
	+ Daily meeting with Alex around 11am
	+ Weekly meeting with entire team on Thursday afternoons
- Alex treated me to lunch :simple_smile:
	+ said he's leaving the lab in August :cry:
- Went through a review of UNIX shell [Link here](https://software.rc.fas.harvard.edu/training/workshop_intro_unix/latest/#(1))
- Research Computing (RC) and Odyssey:
	+ Created an account
	+ Read through several of the docs pages
	+ Watched the introduction video, completed the online quiz and survey (done with necessary steps)
		* [Located here](https://www.rc.fas.harvard.edu/training/introduction-to-odyssey-online/)
	+ Still need to familiarize myself more with file structure of the Work Units -- going to wait until next week to do that since Odyssey will go down for maintenance tonight through the next 3 days
- Did some general customization/installation on the Mac that has been assigned to me for the summer
	+ installed Sublime Text, Chrome
	+ went through all the settings
	+ generally familiarized myself with the operating system -- feeling much more comfortable
	+ generally started establishing a workflow for myself
- Created a GitHub repository for the project
- Reviewed GitHub markdown syntax to create my log and schedule files
- Created a Rough Draft Schedule and asked Alex for feedback -- currently waiting for his response
- *Note:* I won't be able to use Odyssey until Wednesday noon *at least* so I have to put a lot of my tasks on hold. Best to focus on working with the other technologies as best as I can. 


### Goals for tomorrow:

- Check with Siria on:
	+ Slack
	+ Mailing List
	+ Group Calendar
- Check with Alex on:
	+ Draft Schedule
- Start learning about MongoDB and/or Docker
